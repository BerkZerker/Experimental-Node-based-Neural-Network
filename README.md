# Experimental Node-based Neural Network

A research project aimed at developing a novel neural network architecture that mimics human-like cognitive processes through concept-based node activation.

## Overview

This project explores a fundamentally different approach to neural network design by creating an architecture where:

- **Concept Nodes**: Individual nodes or clusters represent specific concepts and ideas
- **Selective Activation**: Only relevant nodes activate during inference, improving computational efficiency
- **Continuous Learning**: New information integrates without overwriting existing knowledge
- **Extensible Design**: Initially text-only, but designed to be extended to multiple modalities (audio, visual, etc.)

## Project Vision

Current transformer-based architectures activate the entire network for every token, which is computationally intensive and differs from how biological brains operate. This project aims to develop a system where:

1. Knowledge is stored in concept nodes that form meaning-based associations
2. Processing occurs through targeted activation of only relevant conceptual areas
3. Learning happens continuously without catastrophic forgetting
4. Reasoning emerges through propagation across relevant conceptual pathways

## Development Approach

The project will follow a phased implementation strategy:

1. **Text-Only Prototype**: Develop core architecture using text data to validate fundamental concepts
2. **Architecture Refinement**: Implement and test node structure, propagation mechanisms, and continuous learning
3. **Multi-Modal Extension**: Gradually incorporate additional modalities (audio, image, video)
4. **Evaluation & Optimization**: Benchmark against traditional architectures for efficiency and performance

## Technical Considerations

Several promising techniques will be explored:

- **Capsule Networks**: For preserving hierarchical relationships between features
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation**: To enable continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting
- **Graph Neural Networks**: For message passing between conceptual nodes
- **Attention Mechanisms**: To selectively activate only relevant nodes
- **Neurogenesis-Inspired Approaches**: For dynamically adding nodes to represent novel concepts

## Research Challenges

Key challenges this project aims to address:

- Balancing explicit concept nodes with distributed neural representations
- Designing efficient node activation and propagation mechanisms
- Implementing continuous learning without forgetting
- Creating an architecture that can scale effectively

## Current Status

This project is in the conceptual and research phase. No implementation code is available yet. Future updates will include prototype architecture designs and experimental results.

## Contribution

Contributions and discussions on the theoretical aspects of this project are welcome. As the project progresses, more specific contribution guidelines will be provided.
