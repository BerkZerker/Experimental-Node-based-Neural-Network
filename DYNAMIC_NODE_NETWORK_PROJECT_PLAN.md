# Dynamic Node Network Architecture

## Executive Summary

This project develops a practical neural network architecture based on **Semantic Concept Nodes** with **Adaptive Activation** inspired by human cognition. Unlike traditional models that activate their entire network for every input, this architecture implements a graph of interconnected concept nodes with selective activation patterns, enabling more efficient computation and continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting.

The implementation follows an incremental approach, starting with a text-only prototype focused on demonstrating selective activation and sparse propagation. Later phases will explore memory optimization strategies and eventually expand to more complex capabilities, maintaining a realistic scope while advancing toward a more brain-inspired computational model.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. Concept Node Framework

The architecture is built around **concept nodes** - practical and implementable units that represent semantic entities:

- **Node Structure**: Each node contains a state vector (implemented as a standard PyTorch tensor) encoding its semantic content, with weighted connections to related nodes stored in an efficient adjacency structure.
- **Selective Activation**: Nodes activate based on a practical cosine similarity threshold compared to input embeddings, allowing for computation-reducing sparse activation patterns.
- **Bounded Propagation**: Activated nodes propagate signals to a limited number of connected nodes based on connection weights and a maximum propagation depth, preventing runaway activation.
- **Incremental Learning**: Nodes update their states through weighted averaging with new inputs, implementing a simple but effective continuous learning approach.

### 2. Dynamic Connection Network

Building a flexible network structure with practical mechanisms:

- **Adaptive Connectivity**: Connections between nodes are dynamically strengthened or weakened based on co-activation patterns.
- **Connection Pruning**: Weak connections below threshold values are periodically removed to maintain sparsity.
- **Topology Learning**: The network learns which connections are important through repeated exposure to related concepts.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Nodes naturally organize into hierarchical structures through connection patterns.

### 3. Memory Efficiency Strategies

Focusing on practical, implementable efficiency gains:

- **Activation Thresholding**: Simple thresholding mechanisms ensure only the top k% most relevant nodes activate during inference.
- **Sparse Operations**: Utilizing PyTorch's sparse tensor operations for efficient computation with minimal active parameters.
- **Batched Processing**: Node activation and propagation handled in batches for efficient computation.
- **Cached Activations**: Frequently accessed node states are cached to reduce redundant computations.

### 4. Periodic Optimization and Maintenance

Implementing periodic maintenance with achievable mechanisms:

- **Incremental Consolidation**: Regular batch processing reinforces important connections while allowing updates.
- **Node Pruning and Merging**: Mechanisms to merge highly similar nodes and prune consistently inactive ones.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Practical approach to adjust activation thresholds based on performance metrics.
- **Training/Inference Modes**: Separate modes for learning vs. deployment with different sparsity characteristics.

## Mathematical Framework

### Node Activation and Propagation

The core node activation mechanics are based on straightforward vector similarity:

```
# Cosine similarity between input embedding and node state
S(x, n) = (x · n) / (||x|| ||n||)

# Activation function with practical threshold
A(x, n) = 1 if S(x, n) > τ, else 0

# Propagation to connected nodes with bounded depth
P(n, d) = {m | (n, m) ∈ E, d < D_max}
```

Where τ is an adjustable threshold and D_max is the maximum propagation depth.

### Connection Strength Dynamics

Connections between nodes evolve based on co-activation patterns:

```
# Connection strength update based on co-activation
w_new = β * w_old + (1-β) * A(n_src) * A(n_dst)

# Connection pruning based on threshold
E = {(i,j) | w_ij > ρ}
```

Where β is a learning rate parameter and ρ is the pruning threshold.

### Sparse Computation Implementation

Efficient sparse activation with standard frameworks:

```
# Mask less relevant connections
Mask(W) = W if |W| > p-th percentile of |W|, else 0

# Efficient sparse matrix multiplication
Y = X @ Mask(W)
```

### State Update Learning

Simple but effective continuous learning:

```
# Update node state with new information
n_new = α * n_old + (1-α) * x
n_new = n_new / ||n_new||  # Normalize

# Node importance weighting for stability
I(n) = Σ (frequency of activation)
```

Where α is a learning rate parameter between 0 and 1.
