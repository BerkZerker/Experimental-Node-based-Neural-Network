# Node-based Neural Network Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the node-based neural network, a novel approach that aims to mimic human-like cognitive processes through concept-based node activation.

## Core Components

### Concept Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental units of the system. Each node:
- Represents a concept or part of a concept
- Contains a state vector encoding its semantic content
- Forms weighted connections to other nodes
- Activates selectively based on input relevance

### Activation Mechanism

The activation process determines which nodes respond to a given input:
- Node activation is based on similarity between input and node state
- Only nodes with activation above threshold become active
- Active nodes propagate signals to connected nodes
- This creates a cascade of selective activations

### Learning Process

The system learns by:
- Updating node states based on new inputs
- Forming new connections between co-activated nodes
- Adjusting connection weights based on co-activation frequency
- Potentially creating new nodes for novel concepts

## Architecture Design

The initial implementation focuses on text processing with a modular design that can be extended to other modalities in the future.

### Current Research Directions

1. Exploring capsule networks for preserving hierarchical relationships
2. Investigating elastic weight consolidation for continuous learning
3. Testing graph-based message passing for node propagation
4. Balancing explicit concept representation with distributed neural processing

## Roadmap

The implementation roadmap is detailed in the PROJECT_PLAN.md document.
