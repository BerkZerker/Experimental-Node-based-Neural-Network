# **Artificial Thought Project: Summary and Implementation Plan**

## **1. Overview**
This project proposes a novel neural network architecture inspired by human cognition, integrating **Multi-Modal Learning, a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model, and Adaptive Memory Management** to create an efficient, continuously learning AI system. The system dynamically activates relevant subnetworks, consolidates knowledge through a periodic post-processing "sleep" function, and efficiently manages computational resources to optimize memory usage.

## **2. Theoretical Framework**
### **2.1 Multi-Modal Learning and Conceptual Nodes**
- The system uses **multi-modal neuron-based nodes**, where concepts and ideas are represented as interconnected nodes trained using diverse input types (text, audio, video, etc.).
- Learning occurs through **associative linking**, where simultaneous occurrences in different modalities strengthen conceptual connections (e.g., hearing and reading "cats are good pets" links the text and auditory representation of "cats").
- Knowledge is **stored in a meaning-based format**, preventing data overwriting while ensuring efficient recall.
- Inference uses **sparse activation**, allowing only relevant neuron clusters to process a query, improving efficiency and interpretability.

### **2.2 Dynamic Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model**
- Traditional MoE models use specialized subnetworks (experts) for different tasks, activated via a gating mechanism.
- This **Dynamic MoE (DMoE)** model improves upon traditional MoE by introducing:
  - **Adaptive Expert Creation**: New experts are generated when the system detects an unfamiliar input.
  - **Selective Activation via Knowledge Graphs**: Routing is based on semantic similarity rather than static gating.
  - **Post-Processing (Sleep Function)**: A periodic process consolidates knowledge, merges similar experts, and prunes underutilized ones.

### **2.3 Dynamic Memory Management and Efficient Computation**
- Instead of keeping the entire model in memory, embeddings and parameters are dynamically loaded based on relevance.
- A **chunking system** ensures that frequently used embeddings remain in RAM, while rarely used data is offloaded to SSD.
- A **Level of Detail (LOD) system** is proposed, where general parameters remain in active memory while niche details are retrieved on demand.
- This structure resembles how the human brain processes information, allowing for efficient computation at the expense of marginal latency in recalling older concepts.

## **3. Implementation Plan**
### **Phase 1: Foundation - MoE Model with Gating**
- Implement a baseline **Mixture of Experts** (MoE) model.
- Train separate expert subnetworks on different data types (text, audio, video).
- Develop a **gating network** to route inputs to the appropriate experts.

### **Phase 2: Adaptive Expert Growth and Knowledge Graphs**
- Modify the gating network to dynamically spawn new experts when encountering unfamiliar data.
- Implement a **semantic knowledge graph** that links related concepts and directs routing based on meaning rather than fixed parameters.

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Memory Management and Sparse Activation**
- Implement an **embedding strength-based culling mechanism**, ensuring only relevant nodes are activated.
- Develop **on-the-fly memory loading**, allowing embeddings to be dynamically loaded into RAM from SSD.
- Create a **hierarchical memory structure** where core parameters remain in memory, and specialized knowledge is retrieved as needed.

### **Phase 4: Sleep Function for Optimization and Self-Organization**
- Implement a **memory replay function** that consolidates and reinforces learned knowledge.
- Introduce **expert merging** based on similarity scores to prevent redundancy.
- Develop an **expert inactivity tracker** to prune outdated or unused knowledge.
- Add a **meta-learning layer** to dynamically adjust expert specialization, pruning, and merging thresholds.

### **Phase 5: Multi-Modal Expansion and Real-World Applications**
- Expand input capabilities to include multi-modal data processing.
- Implement reinforcement learning techniques to refine expert selection over time.
- Optimize distributed computing techniques for large-scale scalability.

## **4. Mathematical and Conceptual Details**
### **4.1 Multi-Modal Association Learning**
- Given input modalities $(X_{text}, X_{audio}, X_{video})$, the system learns associations by optimizing:
  $$
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\| f_{text}(X_i) - f_{audio}(X_i) \right\|^2 + \left\| f_{text}(X_i) - f_{video}(X_i) \right\|^2
  $$
  where $f_{modality}(X)$ represents the embedding function for a given modality.
- This ensures that similar concepts across modalities cluster in embedding space.

### **4.2 Expert Activation and Selection**
- Inputs are routed based on similarity measures, such as **cosine similarity**:
  $$
  S(a, b) = \frac{ a \cdot b }{ \| a \| \| b \| }
  $$
- The gating network selects experts $E_j$ with the highest similarity to input embedding $X$:
  $$
  G(X) = \text{argmax}_{j} S(X, E_j)
  $$
- This ensures only the most relevant experts are activated per query, improving efficiency.

### **4.3 Memory Management and Sparse Computation**
- Embedding culling follows an activation thresholding mechanism:
  $$
  W_{new} = \begin{cases} 
    W_{old}, & \text{if } |S(X, W_{old})| > \tau \\
    0, & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\tau$ is a threshold controlling activation sparsity.
- Experts are periodically merged based on similarity metrics:
  $$
  M(E_a, E_b) = \begin{cases} 
    \frac{E_a + E_b}{2}, & \text{if } S(E_a, E_b) > \lambda \\
    E_a, E_b, & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\lambda$ defines the merging threshold.

## **5. Conclusion**
This system proposes an **efficient, continuously learning AI model** that dynamically adapts to new data, optimizes memory usage, and self-organizes through periodic consolidation. By combining **multi-modal associative learning, dynamic expert networks, and memory-efficient computing**, this architecture moves toward a **self-sustaining, human-like AI** capable of evolving its knowledge base over time.
