# Node-based Neural Network - Project Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Research & Design (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Survey literature on capsule networks, graph neural networks, and sparse activation
- [ ] Research elastic weight consolidation and neurogenesis-inspired approaches
- [ ] Define mathematical representation of concept nodes and connections
- [ ] Design architecture diagrams for core components
- [ ] Specify data structures for nodes, connections, and activation patterns

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Set up project repository structure
- [ ] Create development environment with PyTorch/TensorFlow
- [ ] Implement basic node representation
- [ ] Develop connection mechanism between nodes
- [ ] Build selective activation mechanism
- [ ] Create simple visualization tools for node networks

## Phase 3: Proof-of-Concept (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] Implement small-scale text classifier using the architecture
- [ ] Develop metrics to measure:
  - [ ] Activation efficiency (% of nodes activated per inference)
  - [ ] Learning performance (accuracy over time)
  - [ ] Knowledge retention (performance on old tasks after learning new ones)
- [ ] Compare with baseline models on simple tasks
- [ ] Refine architecture based on findings

## Phase 4: Text-Only Prototype (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Scale implementation to handle larger text datasets
- [ ] Implement continuous learning mechanisms
- [ ] Develop node propagation for knowledge reasoning
- [ ] Test on more complex NLP tasks
- [ ] Benchmark against traditional architectures

## Phase 5: Documentation & Analysis (Ongoing)
- [ ] Document architecture details
- [ ] Write technical report on findings
- [ ] Analyze performance characteristics
- [ ] Plan next steps for multi-modal extension

## Initial Tasks (Week 1)
1. Set up development environment
2. Create project structure:
   ```
   /src
     /core - core architecture components
     /models - model implementations
     /utils - utility functions
     /visualization - tools for visualizing node networks
   /experiments - experimental setups
   /data - sample datasets
   /docs - documentation
   ```
3. Implement basic node class with:
   - Node state representation
   - Connection mechanism
   - Activation function
4. Create simple test case for node activation
